# Spring Boot Spring Fox Demo 
This is a sample project to auto generate api documentation with swagger. I have used spring fox library for this purpose.

## How to run
```
./gradlew bootrun
```

## How to access Api Docs
Swagger ui will be generated at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
If you want to export swagger api doc, you will get the Api documentation in joson format at http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs.
